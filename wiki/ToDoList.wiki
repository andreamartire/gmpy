==Todo List==

MPFR support is not thread-safe.

The display of mpfr object during an interactive session should be tweaked to match the output of __format__(), for some format string. The format string "e" will display the value in engineering format and automatically display all digits. The "g" format string only displays 6 digits by default.

MPC support has been started but isn't yet usable.

A new, modern test suite needs to be written.

Random number support needs to be added.

__format__() still needs to be added to mpq.
